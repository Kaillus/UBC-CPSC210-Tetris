02/07/19: Deliverable 01 - set up main, created Square class,Tetramino class, randNext class
- "ui" package
- main class has main method and calls initMenu() and State.switchState()
- Print statements present

08/07/19: Deliverable 02 - fleshed out game's different states and switching between them, revamped main class, wrote
randNext class which deals with "next piece" generation, added enumeration to Tetramino class, changed Square class to
be future constructor for squares on the (unwritten) game board grid, added KeyInput class which will handle key input,
added Game class which will handle real-time game logic, added DrawState class which draws UI of given state

- "ui" package
- randNext
- main method initializes UI
- sample Square is constructed in main, JFrame and JPanels are constructed in DrawState
- Square has fields and will be referenced in GameBoard code (unwritten)
- a State is passed through switchState to switch game states
- currentState is a local variable within State that determines the current game state
- getState() is a getter for currentState which is used in KeyInput to determine behaviour of keys during game states
- Condition and loop are both used for determining if a line is clearable in Game (temporary pseudocode)
- Call graph is physical
- Flow chart is physical
- Game responds to Enter and Escape keys which do stuff
- Debugger: find currentState and see if problems are due to currentState being incorrectly assigned

10/07/19: Deliverable 03 - added specifications to basically every method and added tests for Square
