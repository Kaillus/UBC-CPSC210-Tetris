# Tetris

Term-long project made for CPSC 210 at the University of British Columbia for the second summer term of 2019. Development was between July 4th and August 8th.

Features failed to be properly implemented in time: proper GUI while ingame, sound, saving a piece for later use ingame, 2 player mode, increasing gamespeed over time ingame

ESC: emergency escape (closes the window)

Menu:
Backspace: opens options, adjust game speed (higher is faster)
Enter: begin game

Game:
Arrow keys: move the piece (up arrow does nothing)
Z: rotate left
C: rotate right
